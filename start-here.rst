Introduction to Git
===================

`Git <https://git-scm.com/>`_ is a version-control system. There are others, such as: Mercurial, Subversion, etc.
Git is by far the most used.

Repositories can be hosted online on web platforms, e.g. GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket. They differ on high-level features, for example, issue tracking, contributors management, integrations, basic features but not on the git core functionalities.

`Aalto Version Control System <https://version.aalto.fi/>`_ is developed on top of GitLab.

Material available
------------------

There is plenty of material on Git available on the internet, but is a little bit hard to find straightforward instructions/explanations.
I collected a few websites that is worth checking:

- `First steps with Git <https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/setting-up-a-repository>`_
- `Training with Git Immersion <http://gitimmersion.com/>`_
- `Introduction to Git: Code Refinery 2019 (~285 min) <https://coderefinery.github.io/git-intro/>`_
- `Configure SSH keys <https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent>`_
